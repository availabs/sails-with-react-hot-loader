# sails-with-react-hot-loader

NOTE: must have `webpack-dev-server` installed globally on the host server.

Runs the webpack-dev-server alongside the sails server, per the Webpack docs:
https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#combining-with-an-existing-server


Uses grunt-exec to start the webpack-dev-server. 

This seem promising:
